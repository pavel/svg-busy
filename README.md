#### Internet explorer support
So your awesome IE doesn't support SMIL.<br>
Not a problem! Refer to http://leunen.me/fakesmile/.
If you're too lazy to read the docs, just add:
`<script src="http://leunen.me/fakesmile/smil.user.js"></script>`
to your page, and voila.

Don't forget to say thanks to http://leunen.me/.
